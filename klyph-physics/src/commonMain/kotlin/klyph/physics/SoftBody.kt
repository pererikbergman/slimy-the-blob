/**
 * A ring of Verlet particles around a core particle. Particles `0 until ringCount` form the closed
 * outline, in order; particle [ringCount] is the core. Three kinds of constraint hold the shape:
 * stiff distance constraints between neighbours on the ring, soft ones from every ring particle to
 * the core (they remember the shape and let it stretch), and an area constraint that keeps the
 * volume, so squashing the body in one direction pushes it out in another.
 *
 * The constraints are XPBD: each has a compliance, the inverse of a stiffness in real units, so a
 * softer body stays softer however many passes run; [tuning] holds them. The core is [coreMass] times
 * heavier than a ring particle and stands for the body's insides: when the outline is held, say on
 * the rim of a gap, the core's weight drags the body through it.
 *
 * Velocity is implicit: the difference between a particle's position and its previous position,
 * which is why [addVelocity] edits the previous position.
